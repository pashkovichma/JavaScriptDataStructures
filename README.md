# Data Structures

##Stack

 A LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure with methods for push, pop, and peek.

## Queue
 
A FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure with methods for enqueue, dequeue, and peek.

## Binary Tree

A hierarchical structure with methods for inserting nodes, searching for a node, and traversing the tree (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

## Graph

A collection of vertices connected by edges with methods for adding vertices and edges, performing DFS, and BFS.

## Linked List

A linear collection of nodes where each node points to the next node, with methods for inserting, deleting, and searching for nodes.

### Min/Max Stack

A class for a stack that supports finding the minimum and maximum elements in constant time (O(1)). Includes methods for push, pop, getMin, and getMax.

### Binary Search Tree Verification

A function to determine if a binary tree is a binary search tree (BST). Provides an efficient algorithm that checks whether the tree satisfies the BST property.

### Graph Algorithms

Implements algorithms to find the shortest path between two vertices in a graph using both Dijkstra's algorithm and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Implementations of Dijkstra's algorithm and BFS for finding the shortest path between vertices.

### Linked List Cycle Detection

A function to detect if a linked list has a cycle. Use Floyd's Cycle Detection Algorithm (Tortoise and Hare algorithm) to solve this problem efficiently.
